• When you are first starting out on the server, you are probably going to want to make some money. The best way to make money is by doing runs. Doing a "run" generally consists of gathering a material from a specified field, processing those materials at the corresponding processor, and then selling them.<br/><br/>
• Before you start your run, make sure that you have everything you need. This basically means make sure you have a pickaxe if you need it and buying a backpack, the bigger the better. The materials which require a pickaxe are as follows: Salt, Rock, Iron, Silver, Platinum, Copper, Oil, Diamond, and Sand. It is also important to ensure that you have the required license to process. If the material is legal, you can buy the license at a DMV, illegal licenses are bought at their respective processing areas.<br/><br/>
• If you are starting out, it would be best to use an SUV as it is fast. This also helps to lower your risk of being robbed significantly. Should you choose to bring a tempest device, you can make it auto gather for you by pressing windows key on it, and then clicking on "mine from device". This will make the truck use a lot of fuel so it would be wise to bring a fuel can. For more protection, you can purchase a gun from a Rebel Outpost, Black Market, or Gun Store. A gun license is not needed at the Black Market, so you might want to consider buying one there if you are tight for cash. A gun is optional but it is good to be able to defend yourself, especially if you are doing an illegal run.<br/><br/>
• After you finish your run, make sure to deposit your money at the nearest ATM so you do not lose it.
