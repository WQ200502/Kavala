	["ThatNerdyGuy","76561198068471272","You guys might know me for my time in Tree or as the career cop John Rottencock.  I am running for Civ Rep to bring balance to the server as I have seen many types of play styles over my 2 1/2 years on the server.  I want to represent the small gangs and groups who don't have an opportunity to speak up for themselves.  If elected, I will make a push to make Cartels and Gang Life more enjoyable as it once was.  Vote ThatNerdyGuy to bring great times back!"],
	["Co1t","76561198065662996","Hello, I'm Co1t.<br/>Vote for me as your Civ Rep. I have been part of this community since 2015, and have put around 3300 hours on this server. I enjoy playing on this server and want to make it a better place. I’ve been part of the APD 4 times and reached Corporal 3 times in a row so I know what it's like to play both sides of the biggest factions. It's time for a change Olympus has lacked a powerful Civilian Representative that's not gonna stop until they get what the people want. For years I have witnessed our great community be continuously pushed over by those who simply don't see eye to eye with the Fun, Fair, and Balanced meaning. I'm not saying I want to stop the implementation of things but for to long we have blindly allowed to many buffs for the APD and R and R to be pushed out for no reason. If you want someone who is gonna fight back an cause a riot for what's deserved don’t look passed this chance your vote counts and highly valued by me.<br/><br/>Thank you for your time,<br/>Co1t AKA EL Man"],
	["ChubbyElf","76561198064426073","I'm not gonna mess around with a fluffy introduction. This is about you guys, not me. Cops have been getting buffs with every single handbook update (Armed jeep, Pharmaceutical tazer rules) at the civilians' expense. My key mission is to reform old content such as DP missions, vehicle crafting, and gas station robberies as well as reducing the disparity between civilians and cops."],

	["Detective Corey","76561198178271038","With very tough competition who are very popular I am sure this will be a landslide for them. Even so it is worth a shot so here's a few facts about me, I am a member joining back in 2015-2016, I have 840+ hours on this server, I am a PO and Adv. Paramedic. Also I am from Idaho so I have nothing better to do than work and play Olympus. The number one question you are asking yourself is why should you vote for me over anyone else? Well quite simply the only answer is because by voting for the average guy you're voting for YOUR voice. I'm with the average person on this server and want to make your voices heard."],
	["Deeno","76561197961912106","Hello, My name is DeEnO. I currently have 879 hours on civ and am very active. I am 30 years old and have been playing PC PvP games since I was 10. I feel I have a good grasp on balance and the need for it. Any suggestions made to me would be considered but not necessarily supported based on my honest and unbiased opinion based on the viability of emulation, the practicality of the suggestions and the integrity of the server. I embrace scrutiny and controversy. I try and hold myself to a high standard but am no way perfect. Please consider me as a possible candidate for the civ rep position."],
	["HunterBklyn","76561198289645104","I feel that I should be accepted because, in the past, I have demonstrated loyalty to this server over months. I have given my time to role-play for this community, I have put in effort that I feel can be better utilized for this server and community. I have gotten to know many players, some of which the ones viewing this application may also know. I have had good and bad times, made mistakes and achieved merit, made friends and enemies on this server. Above all, I am dedicated. I am dedicated and willing to serve my role and do my part for what is necessary for this server to continue to thrive. Though this may be just a small endeavor in my life, it is one I am and will be fond of remembering. Thus, I hope you accept my application, because unlike many other applicants, I feel that this server, its players and myself can get along very well. Thank you for taking the time to read this."],
	["Matt The Savage","76561198131814701","Listen boys, recently Olympus has gone to shit. The APD is controlled by a bunch of pussy fucking snow flakes, gang life is more dead then my grandpa that died from choking on fucking M and M's (true story), the medics are a bunch of role playing retards that never come to cartels for revives. If you want the old Olympus back Vote for me, and if you are a pussy fucking snow flake and afraid of change vote for the ogre looking fuck Orgondo or 4 eyes head ass cousin fucking Dead pool. #MattTheCabbage4CivRep #NoPussyShit #It'sTimeForAChange"],
